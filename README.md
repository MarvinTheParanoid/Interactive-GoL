# Interactive-GoL
An interactive version of Conway's Game of Life




## What to do next...

- test a mouse size variable

- dynamically resize canvas and grid on window resize
    - if possible we don't want to destroy current cells on resize

- test possible blur problem

- add settings menu
    - (resolution, speed, age, maturity, w/h(?), mouse size)

-refactor code!

### At a later date...

- add rules menu
    - let user trial their own rules - select which feature, opperator, and outcome to apply

- rewrite logic in WebAssembly or use Linear Algebra libraries to imporve performance
